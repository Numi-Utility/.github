## About Numi

Numi reimagines the calculator for the modern workflow by blending it seamlessly with a notepad. It's more than just a tool for arithmetic; it's a smart writing space where numbers, text, and calculations live together. You can type naturally, mixing questions, calculations, and notes, and Numi will intelligently parse and compute the relevant parts, leaving your text intact. This makes it perfect for brainstorming budgets, planning projects, doing homework, or simply figuring out complex day-to-day math without switching between a calculator app and a text editor.

The application stands out for its elegance and power. It supports a vast library of units (length, weight, time, data) and fetches real-time exchange rates for currency conversion. You can define custom variables and use them in later calculations, create reusable snippets, and even perform date arithmetic ("next friday + 2 weeks"). With a clean, customizable interface that can stay as a floating window or be tucked away, Numi becomes a frictionless companion for any task involving numbers, boosting productivity for students, developers, analysts, and anyone who thinks with numbers.
